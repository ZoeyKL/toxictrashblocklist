This is a list of usernames of people I have interacted with recently that should be put on a socil network or platform username registration blacklist.

This does not inherently mean they are bad people, but they have done things I have considered to be toxic, abusive, hateful, or otherwise tend towards violating common standards for community rules.

I'm no saint as I put my own name on this blacklist. I have good (enough) judgement, most of the time I elect to ignore it.

To the best of my knowledge, this list does not contain the usernames of anyone who has had a significant impact on my life, friend or otherwise.

If your name is on this list and you would like it removed, you can contact me on any of the socials on my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/zoeykl_official).

You must prove it's your name (beyond editing/Chrome F12 editing), and I might consider removing it. 

People who definitely want their names removed know what they did and I won't remove them without a public apology.
